# Example Images

Some of the original art in Site Kit 2021, including art in this directory, was created in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), which is a neat tool for quick and dirty art with a hand-drawn look. 

Some of the art in this directory is either public domain or licesed under Creative Commons. It is included in sitekit as FPO imagery. You should replace it in your final implementation with art that you can utilize legally, or give attribution according to the terms of the individual artists.
